## Business
Keeping the product free for users with a few ads seems like a good plan. Allowing for a premium "Ad-free" experience is also a good way to get funding to keep the product viable.

## Legal
We would need to make sure the user consents to their information being shared with other users of the site, and make sure the user is easily able to understand all the ways their provided data will be shared. We will also need to make sure that the data is stored in a secure way so that data breaches do not occur.

## Technical
I currently have proficiency in PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL (this technology listed on the project proposal) as I have used them for personal projects and employment. I feel that I would be a good resource to help make this project a reality.
