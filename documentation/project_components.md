* Servers/Machines used: Brian's computer (Apache webhosting)
* Relational Database Software: MySQL (accessed using MySQL Workbench)
* Implementation Languages for each part:
  * Database Server: SQL (specifically MySQL)
  * Web Server: PHP
  * Client Machine: HTML, CSS, JS
* Nature of connections: 
  * All non-client portions of this project will be run on the same machine, so there should be no impact from bandwidth or latency. The only latency that might be experienced is the connection between the machine running the server and the client, which would vary from user to user based on their internet speeds.
